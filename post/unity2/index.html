But some issues were encountered, as the first step was to enable the developer mode. First of all I had no USB-A to USB-C adapter/cable so went to buy one, hoping that it will all work wonderfully. Well, plugin it in my Windows machine, the Quest was charging but didn&rsquo;t offer to enable USB debugging. I then tried it on my Linux machine, it was a bit better but adb commands would tell me that I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t have some authorizations or whatever. Seems that I had to kill and restart the server for the holy USB debugging pop-up to finally show up ! I still have to kill/start the server every time I plug in the Quest but well it works at least so I&rsquo;m not going to complain.</h4>

After two or three tries in order to fix the size of everything and the position of the text everything was working as intended which is pretty satisfaying.</h4>
